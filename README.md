## Description About This Project

This project is over identifying employee attrition using data science. The company wants to use data science to identify factors that lead to attrition at their firm.
The firm wants to identify the top three factors that contribute to this turnover (that is backed by evidence provided by analysis). The firm is also interested in learning about any job
role specific trends that may exist within their data. Any other observations or trends that is found during this project will be analyzed and shown here. 
Models will be built in this project as well to predict attrition. 

Included in this repository you will find the data sets that are used "CaseStudy2-data.csv." This project and analysis will be conducted in the R language. Various questions are answered in this project which you can find in the R-Markdown file.

A Powerpoint presentation is also given in this repository that was presented.
